2013-2014 NBA Salaries

Based on the rosters for 4/16/14

Compiled by me (Patricia Bender) from my own information and sources.
With many thanks to those sources!  The NBA does not officially release
the players' salaries.  This list is a hodge-podge from a few sources,
known information, and my own calculations.  As always, the list is
likely not 100% accurate.

With the 2012 Collective Bargaining Agreement is an amnesty clause 
where teams could release a player and his salary would not count against
the team's salary cap or luxury tax, but the team would still be paying 
the salary owed the player - minus any amount the player was being paid 
by another team if he was picked up during the waiver period.  The 
players whom were amnestied are listed with his former team with the note
of "amnesty rel (date), dnc" after the salary the team owes him (which is
the difference between the original salary and his salary with his new 
team).  The salary with his old team is not included with team's total, 
but is included for the league average salary.
13-14 Amnestied players:
  Drew Gooden by Milwaukee 7/16
  Linas Kleiza by Toronto 7/16
  Mike Miller by Miami 7/16
  Tyrus Thomas by Charlotte 7/10
  Metta World Peace by LA Lakers 7/11
12-13 Amnestied players with 13-14 salaries:
  Brendan Haywood by Dallas 7/12/13, picked up by Charlotte 7/14/13
  Luis Scola by Houston 7/13/13, picked up by Phoenix 7/15/13
  Chris Andersen by Denver 7/17/13
  Andray Blatche by Washington 7/17/13
  Josh Childress by Phoenix 7/15/13
11-12 Amnestied players with 13-14 salaries:
  Travis Outlaw 12/15/12 by New Jersey(Brooklyn)
  Gilbert Arenas 12/9/12 by Orlando
  Brandon Roy 12/15/12 by Portland

Players with more than 2 years of experience and signed to minimum, one
year contracts only count $884,293 against a team's cap (the league pays
any amount over that amount) [or the prorated amount from when the player
was signed or released].  I've listed the player's actual salary in the
listing and for the overall average, but used the $884,293 amount for the
player's team payroll.  Released players signed to non-guaranteed
contracts and minimum players signed during the season are prorated for
the number of days they were with the team or the number of days left in
the season from when they signed.

I've noted where a player's salary is part of a 1st round draft pick 
rookie contract.  1st round draft picks are signed to 4 year contracts
(the 1st and 2nd years guaranteed and 3rd and 4th years at the team's 
option) with the amount a set range based on the draft pick number where
the player was selected.

The team's payroll is totaled from the individual salaries I have listed.
The actual team payroll maybe different from what I have listed as there
maybe other small salaries that I didn't include (ie, some camp-fodder
players from training camp ended up counting a small amount), there might
be some bonuses and trade kickers that count that I don't know about,
and/or some salaries might not be accurate - but the amount is probably
close the real amount.

Abbreviations when space is a concern to keep everything on one line:
m or min = minimum
c = counts (amount counts against team's salary cap)
dnc = does not count against the team's salary cap
s = signed
r or rel = released
s 1/7-1/23 = 2nd date is date of release
if year not listed, the signing/release for this season

----

The league salary cap for 2013-14 is $58.679 million.  The league has a 
soft cap - which means teams can go over the cap to re-sign their own
free agents and can sign players to minimum contracts even if they are
over the cap.
